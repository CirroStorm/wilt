Methodology
===========

Wilt comes with a suite of unit tests that can be found under the test directory.
The tests themselves use the unittest library which needs to be installed and are split 
into test groups.

The test suite contains 3 dart files, wilt_test_browser.dart, wilt_test_browser_completion.dart and
wilt_test_server.dart. These should be self explanatory, the completion interface is tested only in
the browser for conciseness. 

For the browser tests please read the CouchDB_and_CORS document in docs before proceeding further 
unless you already have a working browser/CouchDB environment.

Configuration
==============

All the tests share a common configuration file named wilt_test_config.dart.
The contents should be self explanatory, set the parameters to suit your environment.

Running the tests
==================

Once the configuration is done the test suite can be run.

The browser/console output itself should simply list the tests run, all of which should be passed, if there
is any other output such as stack traces etc. then something has failed.

Lines that start with 'WILT:', are log lines from the test code itself when an error has been detected, hopefully
the log entry should contain enogh information to allow debugging of the specific test.

The test suit can't be repeated until the database it creates is deleted.


Results
========
   
In total you should have one new database containing 11 documents. Note if this is the case then any 
output in the Dart editor described above(excepting WILT: lines) can be ignored as the tests have passed.

The test can take several seconds to run, please be patient
